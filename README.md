This is a fake website template designed to look like a legitimate scammer recruitment site. The purpose of this website is to trick scammers into downloading a remote access trojan (RAT) such as AsyncRAT, LimeRAT, or the Mega Rat Pack, You can also use msfvenom and msfconsole which can be used to gain unauthorized access to their computer or network.

To lure scammers into downloading the RAT, there is a downloads section where scammers can download scamming tools, also known as payloads or stubs.

The website can be hosted on a free web hosting service such as byehost33, which allows the creation of a convincing-looking website without revealing the true identity or location of the creator. The site includes a section for downloading the fake remote access tool for different operating systems.

However, there is a notice on the website indicating that the program has been flagged as a virus by some anti-virus software providers. This is a deliberate deception designed to encourage scammers to ignore any warnings or alerts they might see when downloading or installing the tool. In reality, the tool is a remote access trojan that gives the scambaiter remote access to the scammer's computer or network.

To use this website, you will need to host it on a web host such as byehost33 and modify the download links to point to a file hosting service such as Google Drive, in order to create an instant download link for the file.
